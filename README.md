# Linux on Mac fan control
I am grateful for the work done on the original project.

Note from the original author: "This script has been  primary coded for my iMac 12,1 (2011, 21.5 inch) and was later updated to work as well on the following macs: MacBook 5,1 and 5,2 running Ubuntu 20.04 and Macmini 3,1 (2009 Macmini)."

Additional testing on a classic Mac Pro 4,1 flashed to 5,1 and dual processors running Debian 11 ([TrueNAS SCALE](http://truenas.com)).

## Goals of this branch:
- ~~Get all fans~~
- ~~Standard command line behavior~~
- ~~Add verbs "get" and "set"~~
- Allow percentage as well as actual RPM values
- Live updating option, like 'top'
- Output formatting options
- Add temperature sensor readings
- Saving and restoring of settings
